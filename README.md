Model landing page vehicle maker for C-4

## User Stories
1. as a user I want to select the year, make and model
2. as a user I want to select the template I want
3. as a user I should be able to see the images in the preview and color styling
4. as a user I should be able to insert HTML in the input fields
5. as a user I should be able to download the page I created

## Plan

### backend
use MERN stack
- mongo for my database
- react for the front end

- host the css file and match based on make
- Host images and match based on year make and model

### FrontEnd
- make as simple as possible. I don't want the users to think
- Use adobe XD for wireframes
- ask C-4 for brand colors
